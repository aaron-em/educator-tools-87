## Educator Tool Suite '87

This is a collection of `BASCIA` utility programs for classroom management written by my father, Mike Knox.
They came from an IBM formatted 3.5mm floppy disk, wich was the backup (labeled as such) - So the July 23, 1987 timestamp on `BASICA.EXE` was likely the backup date, not the modified timestamp for the working files.

The program suite includes utilites for grading tests, generating random student seat assignments, handling attendance and grading on a curve. Sure we have all kinds of tools to do these things today - but 40 years ago this was done, without exception, by hand.

If you are a `BASIC` enthusiast or have an interest in the period programming, or if you are an educator in the field, this repo is worth a fork and some messing around.
This is a great example of idea programming (at least in my opinion); automating away the boring, monotonous stuff so all your focus can be on the work you _want_ to do. In this case, less paperwork more teaching ðŸŽ“ ðŸ“– ðŸ§  ðŸ§ª!

### Up Next
1. Encode the current `.bas` files from CP437 to UTF-8 so they can be easily read and modified
2. Get these utilities running in a container
3. Write some basic tests (pun intended) and have them running in Github CI for all the world to see
    - it would be great to publish the test outputs along the way
4. Write up docs and instructions for the different executables
